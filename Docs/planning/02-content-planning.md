- Intelligent intake assessment with weighted scoring algorithm
- User authentication and personalized session history
- Beautiful toast-themed UI with responsive design
- 100% test coverage using TDD methodology

**Results:** Successfully deployed application demonstrating both technical expertise 
and understanding of user-centered design. Project showcased in course as example 
of professional development practices.
